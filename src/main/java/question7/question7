Answer 7 :-

 *  The memory leak occurs, when a piece of memory which was previously allocated by the programmer.
    Then it is not deallocated properly by programmer. That memory is no longer in use by the program.
    So that place is reserved for no reason. That's why this is called the memory leak.

 *  Some idea to prevent from memory leakage ::::-
      * Memory management is Java’s strongest suit and one of the many reasons developers choose
        Java over other platforms and programming languages.
      * On paper, you create objects, and Java deploys its garbage collector to allocate and free
        up memory.
      * But that’s not to say Java is flawless. As a matter of fact, memory leaks happen, and they
        happen a lot in Java applications.
